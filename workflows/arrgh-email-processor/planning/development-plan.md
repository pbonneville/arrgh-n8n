# Arrgh Email Processor - Development Plan

## Project Overview

Transform the existing "Arrgh Email Processor" n8n workflow to leverage LangChain/LangGraph capabilities for intelligent email processing. The goal is to create a local development environment that mirrors n8n's LangChain node structure, enabling rapid iteration and testing before deployment.

## Current State

### Existing Workflow
- **Name**: Arrgh Email Processor (n8n workflow ID: B59fialntF5x0ZUC)
- **Purpose**: AWS SES inbound email processing via SNS webhook
- **Current Flow**: 
  1. Webhook receives SNS notification
  2. Parse email metadata from SNS message
  3. Download raw email from S3
  4. Parse email content (headers, body)
  5. Process content with basic Python logic
  6. Return success response

### Current Python Processing Node
- Basic email categorization (invoice, support, general)
- Simple logging of email details
- Minimal processing logic

## Target Architecture

### Enhanced Workflow with LangChain
- **Primary Strategy**: Replace basic Python processing with n8n's native AI Agent node
- **Hybrid Approach**: Python for email parsing + LangChain node for AI processing
- **Local Development**: Full LangGraph prototyping with direct translation to n8n

### Key Components
1. **Email Preprocessing**: Python code node for parsing and data preparation
2. **AI Processing**: n8n AI Agent node with LangGraph logic
3. **Memory Management**: Conversation memory for contextual processing
4. **Tool Integration**: Custom tools for specific email operations
5. **Response Generation**: Structured output based on email analysis

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup âœ“
- [x] Rename workflow directory to match n8n name
- [x] Create planning folder structure
- [ ] Create local-development environment
- [ ] Set up Jupyter notebooks

### Phase 2: Research & Analysis
- [ ] Analyze n8n's AI Agent node capabilities
- [ ] Map current Python logic to LangGraph components
- [ ] Design data flow architecture
- [ ] Define input/output formats

### Phase 3: Local Development
- [ ] Create n8n node simulator in Jupyter
- [ ] Develop LangGraph workflow locally
- [ ] Test with real email data samples
- [ ] Optimize for n8n constraints

### Phase 4: Translation & Deployment
- [ ] Create n8n configuration exporter
- [ ] Generate AI Agent node configuration
- [ ] Deploy to n8n workflow
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality

### Phase 5: Enhancement & Optimization
- [ ] Add advanced email categorization
- [ ] Implement context-aware responses
- [ ] Add memory for conversation tracking
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Parity**: New system processes emails at least as effectively as current Python node
2. **Enhanced Intelligence**: AI-driven categorization and response generation
3. **Maintainability**: Local development environment enables rapid iteration
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports additional email processing features
5. **Documentation**: Clear development workflow for future enhancements

## Risk Mitigation

1. **n8n Constraints**: Test extensively in local n8n simulator before deployment
2. **Data Format Issues**: Maintain strict input/output format compatibility
3. **Performance**: Monitor execution times and optimize for n8n's limits
4. **Rollback Plan**: Keep current Python node as fallback during transition

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Infrastructure setup and research
- **Week 2**: Local development and prototyping
- **Week 3**: Translation and deployment
- **Week 4**: Testing and optimization

## Next Steps

1. Complete local-development folder structure
2. Research n8n AI Agent node documentation
3. Extract real email samples for testing
4. Begin Jupyter notebook development
